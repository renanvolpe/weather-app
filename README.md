        - Widget -> Widget shared in pages
    - Domain
        - Usecase -> Usecase for each call in app
        - Params -> Params used in functions
        - Abstract Repostirory -> repositories Abstracts
    - Data
        - Model -> The DataÂ´s model
        - Impl Repostirory -> repository Implementation 
        - Impl Datasource -> Datasource Implementation
        - Abstract datasource -> datasource Abstracts
